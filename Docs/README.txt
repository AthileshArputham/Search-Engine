This Search Engine code has two Parts 
1) The first one is the Preprocessing and Indexing of data
2)The second is the Querying of the index

For making the project work First have the code from "Preprocess_Store" which preprocesses and pickles the index
for the second code to use


Now run the Second code which will open a Gui for user friendliness which will promt user to enter a query
NOTE: the query should not be too long.
      Once the button "Search" is pressed ,there will be a pop-up displaying top 15 Relavant documents according to our model
      User can clear the text-area after getting the result and type an other query .
      To exit click on the X on the main Frame
